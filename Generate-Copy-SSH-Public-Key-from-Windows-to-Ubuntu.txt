How to copy SSH Public Key from Windows to Ubuntu
1. EDIT Download cmder or use your favorite console emulator. Move your public key (id_rsa.pub) and your private key (id_rsa) to C:\Users\yourUserName\.ssh\ create the .ssh folder if needed.
2. On your windows host via cmder:
	$ cp C:\Users\yourUserName\.ssh\id_rsa.pub C:\Users\yourUserName\authorized_keys
3. On your ubuntu host:
	$ service ssh status #Start sshd if necessary
	$ mkdir ~/.ssh/ (if it doesn't already exist)
4. On your Windows host via cmder:
	$ cd C:\Users\yourUserName\
	$ scp authorized_keys login-id@ubuntu-Host-Ip:~/.ssh
5. On your Ubuntu host:
	$ chmod 700 ~/.ssh
	$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
6. On your Windows host via cmder:
Test if you can ssh into your ubuntu host without login/pw auth. If yes:
7. rm C:\Users\yourUserName\authorized_keys
(you might encounter difficulties running your ssh-agent on windows, write a comment if so)
